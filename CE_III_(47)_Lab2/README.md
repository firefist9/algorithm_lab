## Conclusion
**Insertion Sort**
The major advantage of this sorting algorithm is that it is simple to implement and efficient for smaller data sets. 
The best case has a linear running time ( O(n)).In each iteration, the first remaining element of the input is only compared with the right-most element of the list.
The worst and average case has quadratic running time ( O(n^2)).

**Merge Sort**
In Merge sort both average and worst case has running time O(n*logn).

Insertion sort has running time O(n) for best case, however, the average case is O(n^2) which is greater than 
O(n*logn) (i.e. merge sort). So, merge sort seems to be effecient for all kinds of ordered data.
